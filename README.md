# Blockchain Explained

Dapp is a decentrailized application and it backend cod runs on a decentralized peer to peer network in contrast to an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers

#### Example 1
**Open Bazaar** is a decentralized Ebay. Ebay decided what you can sell and collects,but with Open Bazaar  lets buyers anD sellers connect without a 3rd party interaction like Ebay. 
It uses Bitcoin for payments and has dope algorithms to solve interesting problems. For example, when it comes to the issue of identity, the use an algorithm called PROVE TO BURN to ensue that sellers can create a million stores to avoid a bad repuataion. 

#### Example 2
**Synereo**- a decentalized and distubuted social network owned by the people who used it. It uses it own currency called Amp. Unlike FB and Twitter where the middle man gets all the money for your data from ads, te network is P2P. If someone wnats to pay for your dtata or attention, they'll pay you directly with amps (Another example : **Steemit**

#### Example 3
**La'Zooz** - decentralized Uber. It's owned by people who use it and uses the currency is called Zoos tokens

#### Example 4
**Opus** let music creatos keep all the revenue they earn

#### Example 5
**Numerai** lets users earn money/crytocurreny by contributing to a crows source hedge fund

## How does Blockchain Work
As the internet grows, we've collectively defnied a standard of how internet devices should communicate called the Internet Protocol Suite
1. At the lowest level, the link layer put the data on a wire
2. At the internet layer, it routes data
3. The transport layer deliver abstraction of it in the form of apps
4. The application layer deliver abstraction of in the form of apps

There is no protocol to exchange value? The main way it is done now was invented pre internet and it requires a centralized clearing house so machine sometimes wait for days for a payment to transfer. 

Cryptocurrenies are th 5th protocol layer for value transfer and Blockchain makes it possible.

## How can Blockchain be used to promote AI?
1. ***How do you know the data is quality?*** You have to trsust a single source unless you use a blockchain i.e. DeepMind is using a blockchain to create a publicly veriable auditing system for health care. It records ever y interaction with senstive patient data so patients knows when a piece of thier data has been used and the reason why.

2. Peer and Peer model training - instead of training model with AWS or Google Cloud, you could rent out spare computing rower to train models and get paid in **tensor coin**

3. Build companies that are entire ran by AI blockchain.

## DAPPS
- Deep learning adds a layer of intelligene which can accomplish almost any task with the right data set
- **Ethereum** acts as a decentalized **computing platform**
- **Interplanetary file system** acts a decentalized **storage network**

## Interplanetart File System (IPFS)
- Moving toward permanent internet where links never die an no entity (company) owns your data. 
- While HTTP web is IP addewssed, IPFS is content address
- It makes bandwidth much more efficent
- Anyone can provide storage for IPFS data- the storage providers are incentived by cryto
- Data permanence is achieved by IPFS
- HTTP Web is slow impermanent and centralized and IPFS aims to create a permanent web where links are contact addressed not IP addressed. 

- IPFS uses a Distrubuted hash tables and a bit torrent bechanism (BitSwap) to exchange data and maximize bandwidth.
